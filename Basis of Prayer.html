<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">It’s the week after Easter, and because Jesus is a risen Savior not just a teacher, we can say that Jesus, in a sense, does not </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">point</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> the way to God; he </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">is</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> the way to God. He doesn’t just point the way to God as if he was just a teacher, but he </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">is</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> the way to God because he’s risen. In this passage, he shows us that if that’s true, </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">if he doesn’t just point the way to God but he </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#e31a1c;">is</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;"> the way to God, that means for Christians, prayer is a unique, radically different process than it is for other religions and other philosophies and so on.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Prayer is a rather universal thing. In fact, whenever they give surveys on how many people pray, it’s astonishing the percentage of people … it’s virtually everyone … who say, “Sometimes I have or I do pray.” There are many ways to pray. Jesus here shows us there is a way to pray he calls the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">pagan</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> way, and then there’s a way to pray that is the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">Christian</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> way.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">He says, “When you pray, don’t be like the pagans.” When we think of </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">pagans</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">, we immediately think of irreligious people. The word </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">pagan</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> today tends to mean a violent person or a lascivious person or an extremely skeptical or irreligious person. I admit sometimes I’ll use the word that way too. But Jesus is not saying that here. He’s talking about people who pray all the time. They babble. They pray maybe more than you and I. They have many words.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">He’s showing us here that the real difference, the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">real dividing line that goes down the middle of humanity that divides people, in Jesus’ mind, is not so much the religious from the irreligious but the religious from the Christian</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">, the people who pray as the pagans and the people who pray “Our Father.” He says, “Don’t pray like the pagans. They think they are to be heard because of their many words. But,” he says in verse </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Mt6.8"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">8</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">, “your Father knows what you need.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Many people look at verses </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Mt6.7"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">7</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> and </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Mt6.8"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">8</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> and say, “What Jesus is talking about is whether to ask God for things.” Some people look at verse </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Mt6.8"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">8</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> and say, “Ah, your heavenly Father knows what you need. Well, that’s Jesus saying you don’t need to pray, or you don’t need to ask for things.” Obviously that’s not the case, because just a few verses later Jesus says, “Say, ‘Give us this day our daily bread.’ ”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">No. Look at what Jesus is saying. Jesus says there are two different bases on which you can approach God. He says the pagans … Now these are religious people, because they’re praying a lot. The pagans think they will be heard because of one thing. Don’t be like them. Go as if God is your Father. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">He’s not talking about </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#e31a1c;">whether</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;"> to ask; he’s talking about </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#e31a1c;">how</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;"> to ask. He is talking about two different bases on which you can go to God, two utterly different ones.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">In other words, you can pray … Plenty of people who think they’re Christians who are part of the church and who recite “Our Father” don’t </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">pray</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> “Our Father.” They don’t go to God, our Father. They do pagan prayer. In fact, they, in a sense, have a pagan relationship to God. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">Jesus says the key is … </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000;">What is the cause for which you will be heard?</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;"> That affects everything. We have to look at ourselves.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">Going to church, being religious, being busy, praying up a storm … those things do not tell you whether you really are a Christian.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> You have to say, “Why do you think you’re being heard?” That’s the question, Jesus says. Pagans think they’re being heard for this reason, and Christians think they’re being heard for a different reason. What are those two different reasons? I want to look at them with you.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">There are two different ways: </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#e31a1c;">pagan prayer</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;"> and </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#e31a1c;">Christian prayer</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> There are lots and lots of people who can pray, but it’s very different than those who come and say, “Our Father.” Let’s take a look at this. First of all, let’s try to </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">understand</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> the true basis of prayer that Jesus talks about, and then we’ll try to </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">employ</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> the true basis. Since the resurrected Christ gives us a resurrection model for praying as opposed to a pagan model for praying …</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">This is the Lord’s Prayer. We’re going to look at this passage all the way from now until Memorial Day. We’re going to look for the next five or six weeks, and we’re going to see what Jesus says is this great access we now have because he’s risen. He’s not just a dead teacher; he’s a living Lord, and we have this tremendous access to God. What is it? Let’s understand the proper basis for prayer, and then we’ll look and see how to employ, or use, that basis for prayer.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">First, </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">understanding</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">. In verses </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Mt6.7"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">7</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> and </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Mt6.8"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">8</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">, Jesus is talking about two different ways to go to God. When you approach anyone, whether you know it or not (and most of the time we don’t know it), you make implicit assumptions about the basis on which you’re approaching that person. When you approach anyone for an exchange, anyone for an interaction, anyone for a give and take, you have to have some basis on which you’re approaching that person. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">Intuitively, the basis determines the level of the exchange.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">For example, on the streets of New York, you can approach people who are absolute strangers for a couple of things. I approach people and they approach me. In the subway, one of the normal things you can approach somebody for that’s allowed is for directions. “Does this train stop at 34th Street? Am I on the right train? Which way are we going?” When you approach another stranger in the subway in New York, that’s allowed. Why? </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">What’s the basis there?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Well, I guess you could say common humanity. You remember what it’s like to first get on a subway. Unless you were raised here, you know how confusing a subway is. So you have a sense of common humanity there. You know what it’s like to be lost. When someone asks you for directions, you kind of identify with them. They have the right to ask you for directions, or time, or something like that.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">But everybody knows that’s a pretty slim basis, and you can’t go much beyond directions and time. Not in New York City. In fact, not most places. You can’t say, “Could I have your briefcase?” for example. “Mine has a hole in it.” You just know you can’t do that. Why not? You don’t have the proper basis. That’s too much exchange. If you want to have a deeper interaction, you have to have a deeper basis.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Jesus Christ is showing us here that fundamentally there are only two basic ways you go to God. When we think about this, these are the same two basic ways we deal with each other. I’m sure afterward when we have a question and answer time, some of you are going to come down and talk to me about gradations. I admit there are gradations. There’s a spectrum between these two points, but Jesus is talking, I think, about these two basic points, and I think in personal relationships you have these two basic things as well.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">What are these two things? You can have a </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000;">business relationship</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;"> with somebody or, let’s call it, a </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000;">family relationship</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;"> with somebody. In a business relationship, the basis is “I have something for you.” That’s the basis: what I have for you. In a family relationship, the basis is “What I </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000;">am</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;"> to you.” In a business relationship, the basis is performance. You perform for me; I perform for you. In a family relationship, the basis is a commitment, a kind of permanent, committed relationship. Let me show you these two paradigms for a second.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">There are two different ways you can live in somebody’s house. You can live in somebody’s house as a boarder … I mean, these are the normal ways. Somebody is going to say, “I can think of exceptions.” Okay. “I can think of spectrums.” All right. I’ll show you some of them, as a matter of fact, but for right now let’s look at the two basic categories. Generally, you either live in somebody’s house as a boarder or as family.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">For example, you may live in a house as a boarder, and the person who owns the house is your landlord. You can have a pretty good relationship with that person as long as you pay the rent and respect the property. There are rules for the tenant. The landlord also has certain rules. The landlord has to do maintenance and so forth. You can have a pretty good relationship, so there’s a basis for approach. But the interchange is a mechanical one of goods and services. It’s a business relationship. It’s mechanical (we’ll get into that); it’s of goods and services, largely.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">In fact, I remember talking to a lady once who was in Virginia. She had a large house, and she used to rent out parts of it. She said, “One of the big problems with when you live in the same house and you see the boarders every day is the relationship continually tries to move off of a business relationship. You start to not just give goods and services … money and maintenance and all … you start to listen to their problems. You start to get into friendship.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">She said, “Wow, that’s dangerous,” I remember she told me one day. I said, “What do you mean, it’s dangerous?” She said, “Well, what happens when you have to put the screws to somebody because they’re not paying the rent, or because they’re not caring for the property, and they’ve become your friend?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">What she’s saying is a </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">business relationship is a </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#e31a1c;">conditional</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;"> one</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">. A family relationship is moving toward being </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">unconditional</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">The business relationship is based on what you </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000;">have</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;"> … performance. A family relationship is moving toward what I </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000;">am</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">. One is </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000;">conditional</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">; one is </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000;">unconditional</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">. One has to do with your </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000;">doing</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">; one has to do with your </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000;">being.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;"> She said, “You have to watch out. You can’t become friends with the tenants.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">This is also a problem you can sometimes see at work, can you not? When you supervise somebody who ends up becoming your friend, then what happens when they’re not toeing the line? What happens if they’re not coming through on their job description? What happens? It’s very dissonant. That just goes to show my point, that there are two basic kinds of relationships, and there’s a tension between them.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">You can also live in the home of your parents. In that case you’re not a boarder; you’re a child. Now we’re moving all the way to the other side of the spectrum. In a situation like that, you know the paradigm is different. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">The way the business paradigm is supposed to work is if you perform, you’ll be accepted. The way the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#e31a1c;">family</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;"> paradigm is supposed to work is since you’re accepted you should perform. Two completely different paradigms, two completely different ways of doing things.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">Jesus says, “You can either approach God on a business basis or on a family basis.”</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> He says, “Now here’s how you can tell whether you’re approaching God on a business basis or a family basis.” There are many ways to do it, but </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">he’s using prayer as an example</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">. He’s looking at people, many of whom are not Christians … Pagans are not Christians. Many people in the church, or many people who </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">think</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> they’re Christians, are not Christians. Jesus is giving you a test to see on what basis you go to God.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">He says, “You will babble, and your words will be many.” These are kind of interesting, these two. In the Old King James Bible it says, “They heap up empty phrases, and they think they will be heard for their vain repetitions.” If you do a little bit of digging … Obviously those words have various nuances. In the 1984 New International Version it says, “When you pray, don’t keep babbling. They think they’ll be heard because of their many words.” </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">Babbling</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> is a Greek word that means empty words. The word </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">many</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> at the end of the sentence is a word that means anxious.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">Here’s how you know whether you’re a pagan or a Christian. What happens when your prayers aren’t answered? When your prayers aren’t answered, you will find you will either be cold or anxious. You’ll be cold because you say, “I’ve been paying the rent, and I deserve from you.” Or you’ll be anxious, because you’ll say, “I have not been paying the rent, and therefore, I’m probably guilty.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Think about this. If you find your life isn’t going right … You pray and things just aren’t going right. They’re not going well. What’s your response? If you get angry, or if you get guilty … If you get angry you feel like, “God is not coming through, and I deserve because I’ve been a good person. I’ve been paying the rent.” If you get guilty you feel like, “I guess I’ve been letting down. I haven’t been paying the rent.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">In either case, you prove you’re a boarder not a child. In either case you believe at a fundamental level that your relationship with God is a business one. It’s based on your performance and his. You have your duties; he has his duties. Don’t you see the difference? A religious person says, “God, come into my life. Be my landlord. I’ll do my part and you do yours.”</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">A Christian is someone who says, “God, come into my life. Be my Father. I am not worthy of your favor, but Jesus Christ has lived the life I should have lived and died the death I should have died, and as a result, on the basis of what he has done, be my Father.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Those are two different paradigms. The way you can tell is to look at your prayer life. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">Babbling</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> is a word that means empty, cold, impersonal, mechanical. There’s no love, there’s no grace, there’s no sweetness, there’s no fullness in your praying. I know this is a frightening thing. This is a very frightening thing. And I know a lot of you will never pray out loud in my hearing ever again. But that’s not the point. Don’t think about that. Don’t think about what I think about …</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">We’re not talking about eloquence here. We’re not talking about articulateness. Are your prayers cold and impersonal? Do you do them just because you’re supposed to do them? Are they kind of irritated because God is not coming through? Or are they many? Are they anxious? Are they always guilty? Are they always feeling like, “I really don’t deserve anyway. I don’t know what I’m praying for. God never comes through to me. I guess I haven’t been a very good Christian. I must be an awful, terrible person.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">Is that your prayer life? Anxious, cold, impersonal, mechanical, or warm, confident, loving, personal? Is your relationship with God that of a boarder or that of a child? Do you see why this is so absolutely critical? Jesus does not start the Lord’s Prayer, “Our King,” though he is. He doesn’t start the Lord’s Prayer, “Our Creator,” though he is. In fact, he doesn’t even start the Lord’s Prayer, “Our Friend.” Do you know why? Because even friendship … Friendship, I think, is a kind of hybrid between business and family. When you get to a friend, even friendship is based to a great degree on your performance.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Those of you who say, “The trouble with you talking about the family … My family is a wreck. The human family is a mess.” Even the messiness and brokenness and dysfunction of the human family prove the strength of the paradigm. Why? A lot of us in this room have dealings still with brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, children, sons and daughters, fathers and mothers.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">We still have dealings with people whose behavior and whose history have been such that if they were anything else but members of our family we would have nothing to do with them anymore. Why do you still have any dealings with them? Why is there still an interchange? Why is there still some exchange going on? Because they’re family. “She’s still my sister.” “She’s still my mother.” “He’s still my son.” What is that?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Jesus does not say, “When you go to God say, ‘Our Friend.’ ” He doesn’t say, “When you go to God say, ‘Our King,’ ” though those are all true. God </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">is</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> our Friend. God </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">is</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> our King. God </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">is</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> our Creator. He says, though, you have to start, </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">“Our Father,” because those two little words will control everything else about your relationship with God.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> In fact, the reason he uses the word </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">pagan</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> here for very religious people, people who are continually praying, people who are praying many words, is he’s trying to get across the point that the fatherhood of God, your understanding that you are an adopted child of God, is the very essence of what it means to be a Christian.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Jn1.12"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">John 1:12</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">, says, “As many as received Jesus and who believed on his name, he gave authority to become children of God.” What does it mean to be a Christian? It means you are adopted. You’re given the rights. When you receive Christ, you are adopted into the family of God. That’s what it means to be a Christian. If you don’t understand that at some level, you don’t understand what it means to be a Christian at all.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Think for a minute. Adoption is not the result of the child’s efforts. The child, in many cases, doesn’t even seek this, doesn’t even know what’s going on hardly. Adoption is an act of the father. And adoption is not a change in nature or behavior. Not at first, right? If you adopt an unruly child and love and discipline that child properly, the child’s behavior will change, but not at first. The minute you adopt a child, the essential change is not one of behavior or nature; it’s a status change. It’s a legal change.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">What does that mean? It means the father legally </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">adopts the child and says, “Now you are no longer someone whom I send home if you misbehave. You’re here whether you misbehave or not.” When you adopt somebody, do you know what you’re doing? You’re legally saying, “I promise to regard you with all of the commitment and all of the love and the acceptance I would my natural child.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Jesus says as much in </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Jn17"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">John 17</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">. He says, “Father, I want you to love them even as you love me.” Some of you know if you’ve been around here for much time, I have never gotten over those two little words. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">Never.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> I hope you don’t either. That’s why I keep bringing them up. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">Even as.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> “I want you to love them even as you love me.” How much does the Father love Jesus?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">When you’re adopted, the Father says, “By fiat, legal action, you cross over from being a no person to being some person; from being not a child of God to being a child of God.” He says, “I love you, and I accept you, and I’m as committed to you as I am committed to my own Son, because you are now my sons and daughters.” Do you understand that?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">If you say, “That’s just too easy,” that shows you’re a boarder and not a child.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> If you say, “I can’t believe it happens just like that. You have to work for it. It’s not that simple.” [Audio cuts off] That’s the reason Jesus is even bringing this whole thing of prayer up. He wants to show you the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">big difference between a pagan and a Christian is not the irreligious and the religious, but the person having a business relationship with God and the person having a family relationship with God.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">In many cases, Christians are people who used to be irreligious and didn’t pray at all, but in many cases, Christians are people who have moved from being religious to being Christian, who have moved from seeing Jesus Christ as an example for our emulation to being a representative for our substitution.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">He says, “He died the death I should have died. He lived the life I should have lived. Upon his death and life I base everything.” That’s what a Christian is.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">Do you understand that? If you do, what Jesus Christ says is, “Here’s how you pray. You start with the doctrine of adoption. You must saturate yourself with the fact that you have been legally adopted by God’s act, not by your act; that he is as committed to you as he is to his own natural Son.”</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> When Jesus starts the Lord’s Prayer, “Our Father,” he says, “You have to get that out every time you have any dealing with God at all. Any time. You have to saturate yourself in it. You have to rejoice in it.” That’s the fire that fuels access into the presence of God. That’s the thing that changes the throne of the universe into a throne of grace.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Heb4"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">Hebrews 4</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> says, “Since we have a great high priest who passed through the heavens, Jesus Christ, therefore, let us draw near to the throne of grace with confidence.” Jesus says, “Get out ‘Our Father.’ ” If you go through all of the rest of the Lord’s Prayer, you see all of the different kinds of prayer. You have </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">praise</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> … “Hallowed be thy name.” We’ll get to that next week. In fact, the whole first part of the prayer is all praise and adoration. Then you have </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">petition</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> … “Give us this day our daily bread.” Not only that, you also have </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">submission</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> and </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">confession</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> … “Forgive us our sins” and “Thy will be done.”</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Jesus says if you don’t understand what prayer could be, you’re like the lady who died in poverty. (I read about this some years ago.) In the attic she had a picture. She thought it was worthless. It turned out to be priceless. She had no idea of the worth and the wealth and the preciousness and the value and the power that was right in her hands, and you don’t either. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">Pagans can’t pray like Christians, but Christians can continually fall back into praying like pagans</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Let me just show you quickly how you must employ the doctrine of adoption in all three … Let me just show you three other kinds of prayer. I’m giving you a kind of foretaste of the future when we get back to this, but let me show you how using adoption utterly changes the whole way you pray; in fact, the whole way you look at everything.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">First of all, family prayer is the only way you can adore God the way it says to adore God. A couple of weeks ago we were going through the book of 1 John in the evening service. In </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.1Jn3.1"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">1 John 3:1</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">, it says, “How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">That word </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">great</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> is a fascinating little Greek word. It’s </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">potapos</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">, which means from what country does the love of God come? A Christian is somebody who finds the love of God miraculous, off the scale, utterly, utterly unfathomable. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">A Christian is somebody who looks at him or herself and says, “It’s a miracle I’m a Christian.” There’s a spirit of wonder. There’s a spirit of praise about everything that a boarder does not have.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Look carefully. If you’re a boarder and not a Christian, praise is unnatural. A boarder can go into God and sit down with a list of things you want, and you can spend 30 minutes easily petitioning God for your desires and your needs, but you’re going to have a tremendous amount of problem sitting down for 30 minutes and praising and adoring him. Do you know why? This is a telltale sign. Unless you are a child and you know you’re a child and you rejoice in that as opposed to a boarder, praise will mean nothing. Adoration will mean nothing. Let me put it to you this way.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">Christians understand the reason they </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#e31a1c;">are</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;"> Christians and loved by God is it’s a totally free gift. Boarders believe they’ve been paying the rent. So when they get an answer to prayer, boarders say, “Well sure. I’m a moral person. I’m a decent person. I work very hard. Of course I had my prayer answered.” When a Christian has a prayer answered, the Christian says, “Incredible. Why would he do such a thing? But he has, and he’ll continue to do it.” There’s a spirit of praise.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">In fact, if you ask a boarder, “Are you a Christian?” the boarder will say, “Sure, of course.” But when you ask a Christian, “Are you a Christian?” there’s no “of course-ness” about it. A Christian says, “It’s incredible, but it’s true. It’s a miracle, but it’s true.” That’s why </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.1Jn3.1"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#e31a1c;">1 John 3:1</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">, says, “Behold, that he would call us the children of God.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">You know what? If you worked hard all week and somebody gives you your paycheck at the end of that week, you don’t say, “Behold! What a miracle! My paycheck!” You say, “Of course. I worked hard for it.” If there is no “behold” about your life, if when God does something good for you, if some answer to prayer comes, if you’re not continually in a spirit of wonder, if you’re not continually in a spirit of praise, do you know what that means? You’re a boarder. You’re not a Christian. Here’s why.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">The difference between a pagan and a Christian … Pagans and Christians both repent of their sins. Oh, pagans know their sins are bad. They recognize their sins are bad. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000;">The difference between a pagan and a Christian is not that the Christians repent of their sins, because pagans repent of their sins too. Pagans do not, though, repent of their righteousness. Christians do. That’s the difference.</span></p>

They’re paying the rent. They expect their life to go okay. They get mad when their life doesn’t go well and when their prayers aren’t answered. They get angry. That shows they’re boarders. There’s no spirit of praise. For a Christian, everything is a gift.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> This is a Christian:</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">Petition</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> … “Give us this day our daily bread.” Notice Jesus does not say, “Give us this day our </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">monthly</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> bread,” or even, “Give us this day our </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">weekly</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> bread.” He says </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">daily</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">. What does that mean? Jesus Christ throughout, not only here but everywhere else, says it’s the job of the Christian to bug God for your needs. He says in </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Lk11"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">Luke 11</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> … There’s a parable there. He tells us, “Be persistent.” The word </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">persistent</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> is a Greek word that should be translated shameless, impertinent.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Jesus tells us to go after God and pray for every little thing. Go after him shamelessly. Go after him impertinently. Go after him rudely. Jesus tells you to do that in </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Lk15"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">Luke 15</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">. You can see. Look at Abraham arguing with God about Sodom. God says, “I’m going to destroy Sodom,” and Abraham says, “How about for 45 good people you won’t do that? How about 40? How about 30?” Go down there. Look at Moses arguing with God. He reminds God of his promises.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">If you read how aggressively people pray in the Bible, you’ll ask yourself, “How could this be? How could Jesus Christ press people to pray shamelessly and constantly?” I’ll tell you why. I was in a dialogue with some Muslims once back in Philadelphia. At one point we talked about this. I said, “We as Christians call God ‘Father.’ ” My Muslim friends said, “We don’t do that. You mustn’t do that. He’s too great to talk to like that.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">I began to realize, “Wait a minute. The Bible sees God as great.” Look at God saying to Moses at the burning bush, “Take off your shoes; this is holy ground.” Look at God saying, “Don’t touch the mountain when I’m on it or you’ll die.” Oh no, the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">Bible has a great God, but here’s the difference. We’re his children. The only person who dares to wake a king up at 3:00 a.m. for a glass of water is a child. What would be impertinent and rude and shameless and overly-aggressive demandingness in anybody else is natural and normal and acceptable behavior for a little child toward his parent.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">No other religion would dare tell you, “Be shameless. Go to God for everything. You have not because you ask not. Give us this day our daily bread. Bother him.” “Give him no rest,” it says in </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/Bible.Is62"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">Isaiah 62</span></a><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">, “until he makes Jerusalem the praise of all the earth.” No other religion would say, “Go to him for every little need. Go to him convenient or inconvenient. Go after him. Pour your heart out to him.” Every other religion would say, “Oh no. He’s a great God. Of course you couldn’t treat him like that.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">He’s your Father. “Our Father.” If you don’t understand that, there’s no “Hallowed be thy name.” Without “Our Father,” there’s no “Give us this day our daily bread.” Without “Our Father,” there’s no “thy will be done.” </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">A boarder expects to understand the landlord. A child does not expect to understand a parent all the time. Children trust their parents. Oh, they get angry, but a child knows a good father will either give you what you ask or else will give you what you </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#e31a1c;">should</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;"> have asked if you knew everything he knows. Children understand they’re not going to understand everything fathers do, so children can trust.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">If you’re a boarder, you won’t ask aggressively, but if you’re a boarder, you won’t trust God when he says “no” either. You won’t be able to say, “Thy will be done,” unless you understand him as Father. There won’t be a spirit of praise, there won’t be shameless and aggressive going after him, but there won’t be a resting and a peace and a healing of the heart from worry when you go to him. O friends, brothers and sisters who are praying like pagans and pagan friends who think you’re Christians, look at what Jesus says. Don’t be like a pagan who thinks you’ll be heard because of something in you, but say, “Our Father.” Let’s pray.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">Father, give us the time to contemplate what this means. I pray for my friends here who may be pagans who think they’re Christians, that what your Son has said will show them they don’t know what it really means to be your sons or daughters. I pray for my brothers and sisters who are angry because of unanswered prayer or guilty and feel they can’t go to God with their needs.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">Show them they’re praying like pagans, that guilt and self-deprecation and anger and self-centeredness are inappropriate if God is our Father. Heal us now of all of our ills through the doctrine of adoption, that when we receive him you have given us rights to be your children. We pray in Jesus’ name, amen.</span></p>
