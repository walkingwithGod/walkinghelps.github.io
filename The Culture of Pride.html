<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">We’re looking at the book of Habakkuk because </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">it’s a little book in the Old Testament that tells us how to face evil times, whether they’re times of your own individual evil times (because everyone goes through very bad times), or sometimes you have a society-wide evil time. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">The late nineteenth century in America, things got better and better. The early twentieth century, there were two World Wars, the Depression. The late twentieth century, things got better and better. Now where are we going?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">It would be naïve to say we </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">aren’t</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> going into bad times. It would also be probably precipitous to say we </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">are</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">. If you understand what the book of Habakkuk says, you’ll be ready for anything. You won’t be at loose ends. We’re looking each week at learning some things the book tells us about how to face difficult times, especially evil times in a culture.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">This week, God is saying to Habakkuk something about this evil Babylonian Empire that is rising up and is going to be wreaking havoc everywhere. God shows the rottenness at the heart of the culture and shows what is wrong in that culture. As God deconstructs what’s wrong with the Babylonian culture, he actually (I think we’re going to see) gives us </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">two very important principles for facing evil times wherever we are</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">Those two principles are, in evil times, you have to understand with the head the source of the evil, and you need a consolation for the heart in the face of evil. With your head, you need to understand the source of the evil that’s surrounding you. With your heart, you need a comfort or a consolation to help you face the evil. Those are the two things we learn here.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">First of all, we learn in this text something about </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">how to understand the source of the evil</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">. During this great recession we’re in right now, I’ve been reading the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">New York Times</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> editorial page and the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> editorial page every day. They do not in any way say the same thing at all.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Both of them are trying to find people to blame. One narrative is the problem is the greedy business capitalists. The other approach is stupid, idiotic government intervention, ill-conceived, bad government policy. The one says, “We need more government regulation.” The other says, “We don’t need government regulation.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">They’re all trying to find different people to blame, to say, “This is the source of the evil times. This is the source of the collapse and what’s gone wrong in our culture.” The Bible doesn’t let you do that. The Bible is nowhere near as simplistic, dare I say it, as either the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#e31a1c;">New York Times’</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;"> or the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#e31a1c;">Wall Street Journal’s</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;"> editorial page.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> You can write that down. Put it on your blog. I don’t care.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Here’s how we see this. In the center of the denunciation of the Babylonian society and culture, we see all kinds of sins that we identify as a sign of rottenness, a sign of evil. You have in there ruthless, greedy business practices. You have bloodshed. You have violence against the poor and the weak. You saw all that.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">At the top and at the bottom of the description, up in verse 5 at the beginning and down at verse 18 near the end, there are two bookends, you might say, two sources of the evil that when we look at them, we begin to realize aren’t so remote. I mean, it’s very easy to read this and say, “Oh yeah, these Babylonians. How awful! They’re out there burning cities to the ground, killing and raping everybody.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Probably none of you have done that, so it’s pretty easy to say, “Well, this isn’t me.” Look at the bookends. The source at the top of all this evil in verse 5 is, “He [that’s the Babylonian society] is arrogant and never at rest. Because he is as greedy as the grave and like death is never satisfied, he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">The reason why the Babylonian culture is filled with people who are trying to make money and have militaristic power is that in their center, they’re proud (arrogant), and they’re empty. They need to clothe themselves with glory. Over in verse 16, it tells us the Babylonians were trying in all of their effort to accrue power and wealth, to cover themselves with glory and honor.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Two female celebrities (one of which you probably have heard and one of which you may not have heard) in interviews over the last few years have been very open about why they were seeking fame, why they were seeking accomplishment. One of them was Madonna. In her very famous </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">Vanity Fair</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> interview back in the 80s, she admitted she really didn’t feel like she was anything special. She was out there trying to achieve higher and higher levels of celebrity and fame.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">She said something along the lines of, “When I achieve a new level of celebrity and fame and accomplishment, for a brief period of time, I feel special. Then it goes away. I have to reach further.” The other celebrity I’m thinking about is Chris Evert, who was a very famous … In fact, she is in the International Tennis Hall of Fame.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">She was a great tennis player, a terrific tennis player. At one point in one of her interviews, she admitted the reason she was so driven to be the best and to win was she said something like, “Winning made me feel pretty,” which is an amazing statement. Here’s what it means. It’s just like the Babylonians.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">The reason they were out burning down cities and the reason Chris Evert was out there trying to win tennis tournaments and the reason you and I do so much of what we do, even if it’s preaching or whether it’s singing or whether it’s making money or whether it’s moving ahead in your career or whether it’s doing your art, if you know your own heart, you’ll know, to a great degree, it’s because we’re insecure.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">We’re trying very, very hard to cover ourselves with honor. We want to feel beautiful. We want to feel loved. We want to feel significant. That’s why we’re working so hard. That’s the source of the evil. Lewis Smedes, a great Christian writer, talks about pride like this. He is talking about arrogance, pride. At the heart of the evil Babylonian culture and at the heart of every culture, at the heart of your life, he says this.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">“Pride in the religious sense is an arrogant refusal to let God be God. It is to grab God’s status for one’s self. […] Pride is turning down God’s invitation to join the dance of life as a creature in his garden and wishing instead to be the Creator, independent, reliant on one’s own resources. […] Pride is the grand illusion, the fantasy of fantasies, the cosmic put-on.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">The fantasy that we can make it as little gods leaves us empty at the center.… we are attacked by the demons of fear and anxiety. […] So we learn to swagger, to bluff … We force other people to act as buttresses for the shaky ego that pride created by emptying our soul of God. […] Every new situation calls forth the question</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">: ‘</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">What can I get out of this to support the need of my ego for power and applause?’</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">As he encounters new people, he wonders, ‘How can this person contribute to my need for applause and power?’ Vanity creates the need to use people because we cannot keep our balance spiritually if we are empty at the center.” Do you see yourself in that?</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> If you don’t see yourself in that quote yet, just keep coming to church, please.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Lewis Smedes rightly says unless you are profoundly so sure of your value and your worth and your significance that it doesn’t matter that much what people say about you, it doesn’t matter that how much how you’re regarded, it doesn’t matter that much how you’re received because you’re so sure of who you are … Nobody is, by the way. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">If you’re needy and you need acclaim and you need applause and you need people to tell you you’re okay, then you’re out there using people. You’re not serving people.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">You get into every relationship. You say, “I want to be with these people because they make me feel good about myself. I don’t want to be with these people, because these people make me feel bad about myself.” You’re using people. You’re not serving people. See, that pride, which is at the essence of every human heart apart from the intervention of God, is the source of all evil in the world. Even the wicked Babylonians. Do you see yourself?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">So, you see, at the one end of this list of sins is pride. At the other end in verses 18 and 19 is idolatry. Any life and any culture that is not based on the glory and the grace of God will be based on an idol. It will take something good and raise it to an ultimate. It will take something relative and make it an absolute. We do that because of our pride. See?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">For example, if winning tennis matches is the way you feel good about yourself, then tennis is an ultimate. It’s an idol! You have to have it. You have to win. It drives you into the ground. It’s an idol. Every culture, every society, corporately, everyone takes some good thing and makes it an ultimate thing, looks to some created thing to give you and do what only God can give you and do. That creates seeds of destruction in every culture.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">For example, if you’re part of a traditional culture (and many of you are), if you’re part of a culture or come from a culture in which family is the absolute, that’s the idol. You know, family means everything. In those cultures … we would call that conservative traditional culture … because family is an idol, that leads to honor killings. It leads to women as chattel. It leads to killing gay people just because they’re gay.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">If you come to our culture, which is highly individualistic, what really matters is individual freedom, individual rights. That’s the ultimate. That’s the absolute. What do you have in that kind of society? You have sex outside of marriage. You have family deterioration. You have abortion. You know, in verse 17 it talks about environmental sin, harming Lebanon (which is the forests), killing animals. In verse 15, it says, “Woe to the one who gets people drunk so you can gaze on their nakedness,” which is a euphemism, by the way, for having sex with them.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">Liberal people say, “Harming the environment is a sin!” Conservative people say, “Sex outside of marriage is a sin!” Only the Bible says it’s </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">all</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;"> a sin. See, conservative cultures and liberal cultures have their own sets of sins, but because they’re based on idols, because they’re based on making moral goodness and family the ultimate instead of God and his grace, or making individual freedom and fulfillment the ultimate instead of God and his grace, every culture has within it idols and, therefore, the seeds of destruction.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">That’s the reason why (and this is the first point and very, very important) every time evil times show up, everybody wants to find a scapegoat. Everybody wants to blame somebody. Everybody wants to say, “Those evil people over there are the ones who are bad.”</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> If you understand your own pride and your own heart and if you understand that every single culture, whether it’s liberal or conservative, whether it’s capitalist or socialist, whether it’s traditional or individualistic, has within it idols and seeds for destruction, then you’re not going to get into that game.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his famous book </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">The Gulag Archipelago</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">, of course, has been interred. He was oppressed by the Communists. Just when you think he, in his book, is about to talk about how horrible the Communists are, here’s what he says. It’s very Christian. He says, “So let the reader who expects this book to be a political exposé slam its covers closed right now. If only it were all so simple!</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. [Then our problems would be solved.] But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.” That’s probably the most famous statement. “But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">Listen to this. “Confronted by the pit into which we are about to toss those who have done us harm, we halt, stricken dumb: it is after all only because of the way things worked out that they were the executioners and we weren’t.” That is a profoundly Christian understanding of things. He says the line between good and evil … Pride comes from every human heart. Idolatry is at the root of every human culture.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">In every culture, some things are idolized and some things demonized. That’s the thing that’s going to save us, and these are the bad people over here who are harming us. Christianity says our problem is sin. Do you want to know the source of evil in every evil time? It’s me. It’s you. It’s your own heart. It’s infecting every culture. It’s infecting every person. For you to start saying, “These are the bad people; these are the bad people,” you’re part of the problem and not part of the solution. Part of the solution is humility and repentance.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">It’s amazing what Solzhenitsyn said. He says when you’re about to throw your executioners into a pit because of what they’ve done, if you’re a Christian, you understand … If you have a Christian worldview, you realize you have all the seeds in your own heart to be what those people were. It’s only the grace of God that you’re not an executioner. Do you get that? Do you understand that? How crucial it is when you’re in evil times not to find the perpetrators and say, “They’re the horrible people! Off with their heads!” That’s the Babylonian way. Don’t you do that.</span></p>

If they had said, “Ah, the line between good and evil goes down the middle of every human heart. Ah! Okay, no matter what culture, there are seeds of destruction. No matter what the human being, there’s pride …” No, instead they heard the Nazis say, “The Jews are doing it. The capitalists doing it. There’s the problem.” They put the Nazis into power, and the rest is history.</span></p>

In politics, you will say what Solzhenitsyn said. The line between good and evil goes down the middle of every human heart and, by the way, every political party. You know, when Solzhenitsyn says when you’re about to throw the executioners in the pit and then you begin to realize it’s only the grace of God that </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">you’re</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;"> not the executioner …</span></p>

You’re going to be someone who divides the world into good and evil,” I always say it depends on what you think the absolute truth of God is. If it’s the gospel (and it </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">is</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;"> the gospel), then you’ll know the problem is sin. The answer is grace, not, “The problem is </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">those</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;"> people, and the answer is </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">these</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;"> people.”</span></p>

There are two wonderful verses in the midst of all this darkness. You notice how suddenly there’s all this darkness … death and judgment and wrath and bloodshed. Then all of a sudden in verse 14 and in verse 20, there are these flashes of light in the darkness. I love that.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">They’re stunning and sharp and surprising. You’re reading along, and all of a sudden it says, “But the Lord is in his holy temple …” All of a sudden it says, “… the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” It’s sort of like a flash in the darkness. I believe this is how hope works. If you understand the hope in these two verses, even in your darkness you can face anything. Do you know what they are?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Let’s look at the second one first. The penultimate hope you have in all bad times is verse 20. It’s the sovereignty of God. “But the Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him.” What is that saying? What it’s saying is no matter how bad things are, God is in control. He is sovereign. He is not gone. He is in charge. No matter how chaotic everything is, he says, “I am still in charge!”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Jacob was supposed to bear the messianic seed. Remember? He was supposed to be the one through whom the Messiah, Jesus Christ, came. But boy, did he screw up his life. He lied to his father, Isaac, remember, by trying to dress up like Esau so he could get the birthright. When Esau found out about it, he wanted to kill him. Jacob really mucked up his life, did he not? He had to run away because Esau wanted to kill him. He never saw his mother again. He never saw his father again. He lost his inheritance.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">What a mess! He was away for years and years and years, and yet if he hadn’t run away, he never would have met the woman he married through whom the Messiah came, Jesus Christ. Would you say Jacob’s life was on Plan B? No, I don’t think Jesus Christ is Plan B. “Oh, well that’s all right then that he lied and he screwed up and he did all that!” Of course not! Not at all. It was a mess. He never should have done it, but don’t you see what was going on?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">“But the Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him.” What does that mean? On the one hand, you can really screw up your life. Your decisions count. You’re responsible for them, and yet God says, “I have a plan, and I’m going to overrule all evil, all bad choices. I’m going to have my purposes for you and for the world fulfilled.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">This is what some theologians have called an </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">antinomy</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">. Do you know what an </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">antinomy</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> is? A paradox is a contradiction, but an antinomy is an </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">apparent</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> contradiction. It just </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">looks</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> like a contradiction. One of the antinomies of classic antinomies is light sometimes acts as a wave, sometimes as a particle. Particles and waves aren’t the same thing, so how can light be both wave and particle? We don’t know. It’s an apparent contradiction, but that’s just the way it is.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Now God says, “I am completely in control. Everything that happens is only according to my will, and yet every single person who is doing my will is responsible for what they do. Their choices count. They’re not puppets.” See, we have a tendency to say, “If God is in control of everything, then we’re just puppets. We can’t help what we’re doing.” Or we think, “If my decisions count, then it’s possible for us to kind of mess up history and mess up God’s plan.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">That’s just not true. God could never look down at you and say, “Oh, look at Mr. X. Gee, I wanted </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">this</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> and </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">that</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> for him, and he did </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">this</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">. Now what do I do?” Is there any place in the Bible that ever depicts God like that? No. What God is saying is, “You are absolutely free and responsible for your choices. At the same time, there are terrible things that are going to happen. Bad things are going to happen, and yet I’m overruling it all. I am in charge.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">That’s the first gleam of light in your darkness. He never leaves his throne. He is always there. He is always controlling everything. The second gleam and the more ultimate hope, frankly, is verse 14. “For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” I want you to know, everybody, the reason why we are empty inside, the reason why we use people to bolster our self-image, the reason why we’re trying to win tennis matches or be excellent or make money is because we’re hungry for glory. Remember?</span></p>

They were trying to get honor. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">Well, the only glory that really, really, really can satisfy your heart is the beauty of God, the honor of God, the applause of God, the love of God.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> You know, as Madonna said, when everybody is on their feet applauding for the incredible performance, </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-style:italic;">briefly</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';"> you feel special, but it’s brief because what you’re really looking for is the glory of God, the honor of God, the love of God.</span></p>

You will wear it. You’ll breathe it. You say, “How in the world can that be?” Here’s how it can be. Look at verse 16. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#e31a1c;">“You will be filled with shame instead of glory.” Who is he talking to? The Babylonians. Why? Because all of their lives (proud people) … A proud person uses the people, we said, instead of serving them. We use them to get glory, to feel good about ourselves, to bolster our ego, to bolster our esteem. We use them.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Therefore, we deserve shame. We deserve the opposite of what we’re looking for. We’re looking for honor, but we deserve shame and disgrace. What we deserve is the cup of God’s wrath. Drink the cup of God’s wrath. You deserve disgrace. You deserve shame. Verse 16 cannot be read by a Christian without thinking of somebody else.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">Philippians 2 says Jesus Christ emptied himself of his glory. Then he went to the cross. Hebrews 12, says we must “… fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame …” The most ignominious, disgraceful possible execution was the cross, but Jesus Christ drank the cup of God’s wrath. Remember the Father’s cup in the garden of Gethsemane? What does that mean?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">Jesus Christ emptied himself of his glory. The Babylonians (and you and I) tried desperately to cover themselves with glory. Jesus emptied himself of his glory, lived a life of serving others, not using others, but at the end of his life, he took our shame. He took the shame we deserve so when you believe in Jesus Christ, the Father clothes you in the honor Jesus deserved. We seek our own honor and, therefore, deserve shame, but Jesus Christ took our shame so we could have his honor.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">I was reading, and I was talking to some Korean missionaries who told me a very interesting story. In the early part of the twentieth century when the great revivals began in Korea that made Korea go from like a less than 1 percent Christian country to like 40 percent today … There were these powerful revivals in 1905, 1906, 1907. A very interesting part of those early revivals, those early revival meetings, was how often Korean men and women who had been converted were willing to confess sins publicly.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">They were willing to confess they had stolen. They were willing to confess they had wronged other people and asked for forgiveness and wept out their sins. What one missionary told me is very important to know. Of course, some of you certainly know this very much firsthand. The Korean culture is a shame culture. What matters more than anything else is that you bring honor to your family and your people, not shame to your family and your people.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">The worst thing in the world is to be shamed. The worst thing in the world is to lose face. The reason why in those early revival meetings people were able to repent publicly and not be afraid of losing face was they had been liberated from their culture because they realized Jesus Christ took their shame and now they were clothed in his honor. Now they could admit when they were wrong. They could admit publicly when they were wrong. They were freed from the idolatries of their culture just like you can be freed from the idolatries of your culture.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">When you say, “Father, accept me because of what Jesus has done,” to know then that at that moment we are clothed in his beauty and in his righteousness and his honor so the Father sees us as beautiful, we’re no longer struggling to win at all costs. We’re no longer struggling to achieve at all costs. We don’t have to use people. We can serve people. Now we’re part of the solution, not the problem, in every culture.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri';">When evil times come, people get cynical and angry, and they blame others. They lose hope. Christians are the opposite. We should be humble and be willing to admit our part in what’s wrong, and we should have all the hope in the world because the gospel humbles us out of our pride but in such a way that we have more confidence than we had before. Have hope. Have humility by remembering this. “For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” Let’s pray.</span></p>

Help us to understand what you have told us in these wonderful passages of this part of the Bible. Help us to apply them to our lives by your Holy Spirit. We pray in Jesus’ name, amen.</span><span style=" font-family:'Times New Roman';"> Keller, T. J.
